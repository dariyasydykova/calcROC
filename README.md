tidyroc
=======

This a repository for an R package `tidyroc`. `tidyroc` is currently
under development, and I plan to release it this summer (summer 2019).

Usage
=====

`tidyroc` has 3 primary functions:

-   to generate values to plot a receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
    curve  
-   to generate values to plot a precision-recall curve  
-   to calculate areas under an ROC and precision-recall curves (AUC)

`tidyroc` is designed to be integrated with the Tidyverse. It is intended to work with `broom` and `ggplot2`.
